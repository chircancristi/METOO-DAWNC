            <p>
                MeToo is a PWA in which users, authenticated via a social media account, can post a listing of the
                activity (coding / studying) they are conducting while in a public place. Said listings can use certain templates like:
                <code>
                    implementing &ltsoftware&gt using front-end &ltlibrary&gt and &ltplatform&gt as back-end for &ltprogramming-language&gt
                </code>
                or
                <code>
                    studying &ltconcept|technology&gt
                </code> .
                <br>
                Each user can specify a list of abilities for a given task related to the listing, e.g.
                <code>
                I'm a &ltexpert|novice&gt at &ltprogramming&gt using  &ltlanguage|paradigm|framework&gt and for &ltdesign&gt I've worked with &ltsoftware&gt
                </code>
                <br><br>
                The collection of listings available on the <code>browse-listings</code> page is on first load filtered using the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>the skills required for the listing must match the user's skills</li>
                    <li>the location of the listing must be in the proximity of the user</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The users interested in certain technologies/abilities will be notified when another user posts a
                listing that has in its description said technologies/abilities. 
                Users can also chat using the <strong>comment section</strong> of the listing and invite other user out for a co-working session.
                Notifications regarding comments will be issued to all the people collaborating on a issue.
                <br><br>
                The popular places (the ones with the most activity recorded on the platform) will be presented in an
                attractive manner with details regarding the frequent users.

                    Apps</a> (PWAs) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the
                user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access
                traditionally available only to native mobile applications. PWAs are an emerging technology that
                combine the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers to provide benefits of a rich mobile
                experience.

                   For our aplication the <strong>Manifest.json</strong> which will provide information about the app will look like this: <br>

                   The service worker will cache the app shell which will consist off:

                   </ul>
                   The service worker will also store locally dinamic content using the 
                   cache then network strategy. If the user loads a page, 
                   two requests will be sent asynchronously: one to the cache and one to the network.
                   If the request for the cache finds the data, it will first check if 
                   there is any data fetched from the network. If not, the page will be rendered 
                   with the data from the cache.
                   If the request for the network finds any new data, it will cache it then will render
                   the page with the data.

                platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014. In our aplication we will use the following

                The sign-up process will be handled by firebase.auth() using the selected provider. (google,github)
                The user will be redirected to the provider log in page.  Onced loged firebase.auth() will create

                    role="doc-biblioref">feature branch workflow</a>. For each feature we created a new branch with a
                suggestive name related to the issue describing the feature. After the work on the said feature was
                done, a pull-request is created. In addition, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">code
                    review</a> and conflicts solving, a merge with the <code>master</code> branch follows.
